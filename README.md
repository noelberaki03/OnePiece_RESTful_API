# One Piece RESTful API
Created a RESTful API utilizing Spring Boot to manage character data from one of my favorite tv shows, One Piece. Character data extracted from a PostgreSQL database containing
over 300 characters. API implemented with CRUD operations of creating, reading, updating, and deleting character records.
